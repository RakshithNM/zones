ðŸ’» Build Web Components so we have UI elements that can be used across NUITEQ Products

```html
  <button></button>

  VS

  <nuiteq-primary-button></nuiteq-primary-button>
```

WHY?
  1. As a company it is best, if users are familiar with the NUITEQ Products, so building NUITEQ elements like buttons which a particular color and is across products. If we launch multiple SAAS products and it makes sense for us to have a common design language across products so people get more and more aware of NUITEQ design language.

  2. More defined and refined product development.

  3. Better and easy handover of designs.

  4. Better code quality.

  5. No more missed hover gradient styles on buttons :P
